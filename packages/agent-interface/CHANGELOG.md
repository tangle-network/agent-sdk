## 0.13.0

- 5d8d8ec: BREAKING: remove the deprecated `question` stream event and `submitQuestionAnswer` adapter method. Use the generalized `interaction` event (`kind: "question"`) and `respondToInteraction` introduced in 0.12.0.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- c63e325: Add the generalized interaction contract for human-in-the-loop.

  `InteractionRequest`/`InteractionResponse` envelope with a self-describing `answerSpec` (text/number/boolean/select/secret fields), an open `kind` label (well-known: `question`, `permission`, `plan`), graduated `PermissionGrant` values, generic `validateInteractionAnswer`, the `respondToInteraction` adapter method, and a `BackendCapabilities.interactions` declaration. New ask types need no contract change; the shape mirrors MCP elicitation. The legacy `question` stream event and `submitQuestionAnswer` adapter method remain (deprecated) for back-compat.
